## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No comments found?**
* Ensure you've scrolled to load all comments
* Some posts may have comments disabled
* Private posts require login access

**Files not downloading?**
* Check browser download settings and pop-up blockers
* LinkedIn blocks zip files, so files download individually
* Clear browser cache if downloads hang

**Missing post information?**
* Tool automatically detects post type
* Regular posts only extract comments (this is intentional)
* Link posts get full analysis including post data

**Timestamp extraction issues?**
* Some very old posts may have different URN formats
